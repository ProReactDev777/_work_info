Dear leads.

We provided different addresses according to units for following purposes.
  - In case of accidents happening due to uncleaned funds deposit, we can check easily which unit fund made issue and will let that unit take responsibility.
  - We can avoid confusion for summing up each unit income.
 
That's why, if you are paying instead of other units, Pls let those units provide you their own addresses and then deposit to their own addresses.


PS. I appreciate that all leads have deep knowledge on crytocurrency transactions, and Wish you could deposit only clean ones actively by yourselves.

Best regards
