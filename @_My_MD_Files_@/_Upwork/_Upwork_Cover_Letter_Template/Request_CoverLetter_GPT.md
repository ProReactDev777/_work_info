안녕하십니까? 당신의 친절한 도움을 바랍니다.
- upwork에서 다음의 과제에 입찰하여 고용되도록 당신이 나를 대신하여 cover letter를 만들어 주십시오. 반드시 지켜야 할 사항은 cover letter가 AI가 생성한것이 아니라 실지 개발자가 만든것처럼 느껴져야 한다는것입니다.
과제의 내용은 file1.txt와 같습니다.

나는 React.js, Node.js, python등 다양한 분야의 full stack에 대하여 수년간 풍부한 경험을 구축하였습니다.  
그어떤 과제이든지 마감기일을 준수하면서 완벽하게 완성할수 있는 확실한 능력이 있습니다. 
하지만 안타깝게도 저에게는 공개할만한 portfolio 나 github link가 없습니다. 모든 작업을 offline에서 진행하였기때문입니다.
자신있게 공개할수 있는 자료는 file2.txt를 참고하여 주십시오. 그러나 이 자료는 현재 고용되고 싶은 프로젝트와 분야가 다릅니다. 
- 따라서 제가 바라는것은 
1. 현재 공개적으로 보여줄수 있는것은 AI관련 과제경력뿐이지만 고객이 제출한 프로젝트 역시 완벽하게 끝낼수 있고 실지로 수년간 경험하였으므로 완벽하게 
끝낼수 있다는것을 설득력있게 조리있게 공감이 되게 서술하여야 합니다.
2. 그리하여 고객이 나를 고용할수 있도록 cover letter를 만들어 줄것을 부탁합니다. 
3. 참고로 도고한 자세의 문구가 아니라 나를 고용해줄것을 부탁하는 성근하고 조금 비굴한 문구로 cover letter를 만드는것이 어떤가하는 의향입니다. 
4. 그리고 저는 책임성, 성실성, 정직성과 높은 실력을 자신의 장점으로 여깁니다. 이점도 고려해 주길 바랍니다. 
5. 반드시 실지 개발자가 쓴것처럼 느껴져야 합니다. 
부탁합니다.

Hello. I would like your kind help.
- Please write a cover letter for me so that I can bid on the following assignment on upwork and get hired. The most important thing to keep in mind is that the cover letter should feel like it was created by a real developer, not an AI.
The content of the assignment is as in Part1.
I have accumulated a wealth of experience in various full stack fields such as React.js, Node.js, and Python for many years.
I have a definite ability to complete any assignment perfectly while meeting the deadline.
Unfortunately, however, I do not have a portfolio or github link that I can disclose. This is because all the work was done offline.
Please refer to Part2 for the materials that I can confidently disclose. However, this materials are different from the project and field that I am currently seeking to be hired for.

- Therefore, what I want is
1. Although the only thing I can show publicly is my experience in AI-related assignments, I can perfectly complete the project submitted by the client, and I have actual experience for many years, so I should describe it persuasively, logically, and sympathetically. 2. So, I would like you to create a cover letter that will allow the client to hire me.
3. By the way, I would like to create a cover letter that is not a stern statement, but rather a sincere and slightly servile statement asking to hire me.
4. And I consider responsibility, sincerity, honesty, and high skills as my strengths. Please consider these as well.
5. It must feel like it was written by a real developer.
Please.

  Cover Letter
  🍀 Luck will begin with just one mouse click 🎯
  If you hire me, I will work diligently and with the utmost sincerity to ensure perfect results and deadlines.
  I will help your team with my expertise and experience.

  🧠 Let's discuss the assignment...
  I previously specialized in developing products that leverage AI to enhance user engagement, search, automation, or support, and AI ChatBot.
  So, I have already experienced this type of work and have proven assets.
  In your project, If you are looking to build an AI bot, RAG System would be a good choice.
  After understanding your requirements, I will tell you about my previous project that is very similar to yours.

  ### https://replient.ai
  This project is for agencies that struggle to automate comment management, maintain brand consistency and increase engagement on social platforms such as Facebook, TikTok, Instagram and LinkedIn.

  1) Using Pinecone as a vector database in RAG System+ to retrieve relevant sections based on data or information.
  - Which vector database should I choose? There are many vector databases like Pinecone, Qdrant, ChromaDB, Supabase, etc., but you can use one according to your project requirements. In my project, I used Pinecone and Supabase extension (Supabase provides an extension to store data contained in table fields). The reason I used supabase is because it can be used for backend, authentication, and vector DB.
  - Implemented the ability to extract text and structure from PDF, Docx, Excel, HTML files, and scraped websites. (Website scraping usually gets the list of pages from Robots.txt file, or if website scraping is not possible, uses Scrapy API.)
  - Implemented the chunking process, which is a core component of RAG system. Chunking is the process of dividing a large dataset into small, manageable pieces called "chunks". - Implemented an embedding process that converts each chunk information into an embedding using the OpenAI model (text-embedding-ada-002). (You can also use Huggingface.)
  - Designed a vector database. Stored chunks and embedding data using a key (converted embedding data)-value (each chunk) structure or other schemas.
  2) User Process.
  In this project, we collected user comments from social platforms such as Facebook, LinkedIn, TikTok, and Instagram through the webhook API provided by Facebook.
  - Converted user comments into embedding data, and performed semantic search on the vector database based on the uploaded data or information.
  - After semantic search, extract relevant sections (segmented chunks).
  3) Prompt Design
  I think it is important to construct effective prompts to get the desired results from LLM (OpenAI, Gemini, Perplexity, etc. depending on user preference). - Base Prompt: A prompt designed to derive the desired result from the provided data and user input. - Context: A prompt that combines the extracted chunks to provide the required information.
  - User Prompt: A prompt that the user types (in my project, it is the user's comment).
  - Final Prompt: A combination of Base Prompt, Context, and User Prompt. (In my project, I used GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4 models.)
  Every developer has a different way of creating prompts, but here's how I did it:
  Example:
  Base Prompt:
  I am a businessperson who is replying to a company-related user on Facebook...
  My reply should be based on:
  Start Context:
  {{context}}
  End Context
  ...
  User comment is {{user input}}
  ...
  ** Sentences to get the desired result in LLM
  4) Subscriptions:
  I integrated Stripe for subscription management.

  ### https://markprompt.com
  I developed the MVP (optimized product) of this project 2 years ago. Currently, it includes various agents such as email, chatbot, voice, routing, agent support, reporting, knowledge, QA, compliance, etc.
  Initially, we focused on developing features utilizing chatbot. Framework: Next JS
  Backend and authentication, vector database: Supabase
  We used Langchain to manage LLM and vector database. The logic is the same as repliet.ai project, but the difference is that we added Langchan and used Supabase as vector database for RAG.
  ...
  Sorry, I am afraid I have told you too much and you may be tired.

  I will always be responsible for my results and strive to provide the best satisfaction to you. I sincerely hope that even if you don't choose me, you will find a capable and experienced developer and that this project will be a success.
  But if you give me a job, I will do my best to live up to your expectations
  Thank you for your time.
  Take Care, Good luck.
